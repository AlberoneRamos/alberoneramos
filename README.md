# How's it going?
My name's Henrique, I'm a 20 years old brazilian guy. I work as a front-end developer at Avenue Code, currently using **React**, and an undergraduate Software Engineering student at PUC Minas. I like to study about User Experience, Design in general, Mobile development and I'm always looking forward to learn about cutting-edge technologies. Lately, I've been diving deep into Flutter development in some of my spare time. However, I spend most of it playing games (And sometimes streaming it to [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/alberoneramos)) and trying to learn how to create Pixel Art.
